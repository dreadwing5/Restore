# State Immutability in Redux

## Why Immutability Matters

Immutability in Redux is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Predictability**: Immutable state makes state changes trackable and predictable.
2. **Performance**: React can efficiently determine when to re-render by comparing references.
3. **Debugging**: Time-travel debugging requires immutable updates to work correctly.
4. **State History**: Maintaining previous state versions for undo/redo functionality.

## Example of Immutable Updates

### ❌ Incorrect (Mutating)

```typescript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  state.value = action.payload; // Direct mutation!
  return state;
};
```

### ✅ Correct (Immutable)

```typescript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    value: action.payload,
  };
};
```

## Redux Toolkit's Solution

Redux Toolkit uses Immer internally to allow writing "mutating" logic that actually produces immutable updates:

```typescript
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1; // Looks like mutation, but Immer makes it immutable!
    },
  },
});
```

## Benefits of Using Immer

1. More intuitive code
2. Less boilerplate
3. Fewer bugs
4. Better performance
5. Maintains immutability guarantees
